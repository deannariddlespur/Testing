Test Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative development cycle that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code.

The process is simple:

    Write your tests first.
    Watch them fail.
    Write just enough code to make those tests pass.
    Test again.
    Refactor.
    Repeat.
